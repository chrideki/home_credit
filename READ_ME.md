HOME CREDIT DEFALT RISK 

Data analysis by Christian Goldoni

This is my capstone project in Data Analyst Training Accelerator class at Galvanize, New York.
Home Credit is a finance provider focus on lending to people with little or no credit history. 
Data is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

Objectives of this work:
1. to understand which variables play a role in the ability to repay a loan
2. to identify the profile of a high-risk borrower and a low-risk borrower
3. to find insights to minimize the risk of default in repayments 

Insights and visualization are available at: https://public.tableau.com/profile/christian3885#!/vizhome/home_credit_dashboards/home_credit_story?publish=yes

In this repo there are three files:
1. home_credit_import.sql is the SQL code that I have used to import all the data in a PostgreSQL dataset
2. home_credit_query.sql is the SQL code that I have used to analyze the data
3. home_credit.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook file that I have used to complete the analysis and to build the logistic regression model
